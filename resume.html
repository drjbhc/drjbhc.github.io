      <p2><strong>SKILLS</strong></p>
	<p3><strong>Leadership</strong></p3>
		<p4>While working for Subway I have often been left in charge during shifts. I have been entrusted this by various managers from various stores in Fargo.</p4>
	<p3><strong>Trustworthy</strong></p3>
		<p4>I have been entrusted by various managers to help train new employees. I have also been entrusted by various managers to open and close their stores by myself, having been entrusted with keys to various stores, not just the main store I am employed.</p4>
	<p3><strong>Teamwork</strong></p3>
		<p4>While working for Subway I have to work with various other people in order to achieve results. If we work without good teamwork then it would result in poor customer service, and thus in order to give the best service possible I have developed good team working abilities.</p4>
	<p3><strong>Microsoft Tools</strong></p3>
		<p4>While in high school I took two semesters of classes dedicated to learning to use Microsoft Office, Powerpoint, Excel, and many other Microsoft tools.</p4><br />
